# 📌 Overview

**IsItPayday** is a custom integration for Home Assistant that calculates and displays your next payday based on your country's holidays and your specified pay frequency.

- **Binary Sensor:** `binary_sensor.<instance_name>_is_it_payday`
  - Indicates whether today is a payday (`on` or `off`).
  - Icons:
    - `mdi:cash-fast` if it is payday. <sup><sup>([See icon](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/icon/cash-fast/))</sup></sup>
    - `mdi:cash-clock` if it is not payday. <sup><sup>([See icon](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/icon/cash-clock/))</sup></sup>

- **Sensor:** `sensor.<instance_name>_next_payday`
  - Displays the date of the next payday.
